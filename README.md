# JavaScriptPasswordGeneratorMadness

##Starter code was semi-supplied to create a password generator for an employee needing assitance creating unique passwords for work station. Additional JavaScript coding was needed in order to fully deploy a webpage that allowed a user to create a unique password of between 8 and 128 characters using upper and lowercase letter, numbers and special characters.

###Credits go to UC Berkley again for this one. The added help from Robbert and Michael once again and all the uploaded videos and feedback given was tremendous!
